This directory contains the specifications and proofs of [the translated Gallina
code](../lib) of Haskell's `containers` library.

We have formalized and proved a representative subset of three modules, namely, 
`Data.Set`, `Data.IntSet`, and `Data.Map`. They can be found in:
* `SetProofs.v` for `Data.Set` (this includes theorems for operations,
  type class laws, and Coq's finite set theorems),
* `IntSetProofs.v` for `Data.IntSet` (this includes theorems for operations,
  type class laws, and Coq's finite set theorems),
* `IntSetPropertyProofs.v` for proofs that `Data.IntSet` satisfies the
  QuickCheck properties from the library's test suite,
* the `MapProofs` directory for `Data.Map` (formalizations for
  `Data.Map` is too big so we divided it into several files under one
  directory).

There is also a small subset of specifications and proofs for `Data.IntMap` in
`IntMapProofs.v`.

All the files follow the same naming convention for theorems. Most top-level
theorems will start with the operations they specify, with `_Desc` as their
suffixes. For example, the top-level theorem of `insert` operation is named
`insert_Desc`. A few operations do not have theorems in the form of `Desc`: they
are specified in terms of equality or iff relations with other terms. These
theorems also start with the names of the operations, with `_spec` or `_eq` as
their suffixes (for example, `member_spec` is the top-level theorem for the
`member` function of `Data.Set`).

Each file contains some comments explaining what has been formalized and
contains some instructions on how to navigate there. Formalizations for
`Data.Map` has its own README file [here](MapProofs/README.md).
